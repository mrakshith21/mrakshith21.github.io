<h1> Hello Carnatic music enthisiasts! </h1>

As a passionate student of Carnatic music, I am starting this blog to 
share Carnatic music compositions that I have learnt.  

Initially, I will post some devaranamas, along with their meanings (if possible).

Kindly do correct me if I have made any mistake in the lyrics or the meaning of any song that I have posted.
